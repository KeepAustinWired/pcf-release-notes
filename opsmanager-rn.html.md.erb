## <a id='major-features'></a> New Features in Ops Manager v2.4

Ops Manager v2.4 includes the following major features:

### <a id="multiple-admins"></a> Ops Manager Allows Multiple Simultaneous Administrators

Multiple Ops Manager administrators can use Ops Manager at the same time, to reconfigure and manage a PCF deployment. For more information, see [Managing Simultaneous Ops Manager Administrators](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-4/opsguide/config-rbac.html#multiple-write-users).

### <a id='credhub-2.0'></a> Ops Manager Uses CredHub v2.0

Ops Manager now uses CredHub v2.0. For more information about how CredHub works, see [CredHub](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-4/credhub/index.html).

### <a id="aws-china"></a> Pivotal Images Publish to AWS China

Users on AWS China accounts can now access downloads from Pivotal Network on their AWS China console. Find specific Ops Manager images in your AWS China console by searching for the AMI IDs for those images.

### <a id="select-all-products"></a> Operators Can Select or Deselect All Products For Deployment

The Ops Manager **Review Pending Changes** page has a **Select All Products** checkbox.
Enabling the checkbox selects all available products to deploy with the next **Apply Changes**. Disabling the checkbox deselects all products from deploying.

For more information, see [Review Pending Changes Page](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-4/customizing/review-pending-changes.html#review-pending-changes).

### <a id="historical-diffs"></a> Files Used During Previous Deployments Are Available for Cloud Config and Runtime Config

You can view the files affected between one deployment and another for cloud and runtime configs.

### <a id="upgrade-config"></a> Config Details Are Available During Upgrade

You can now use the API to access various aspects of your deployment during an upgrade, when the rest of your deployment is unavailable. The CPI configs, runtime configs, cloud config, and manifest are all available during upgrade via the Ops Manager API.

Use `/api/v0/installations/10/products/[guid]/runtime_configs` or `/api/v0/installations/10/products/{director,director_guid}/runtime_configs` to access JSONs with config information.

### <a id="syslog"></a> Syslog Form Template Available for Tile Authors

Tile authors can insert a templatized Syslog form into their tiles by editing `metadata.yml`. This form is identical to the Syslog form in Ops Manager and the BOSH Director. This form template is an opportunity to make tile users' experience more consistent and secure. 

For more information about modifying `metadata.yml`, see [Property Template References](https://docs.pivotal.io/tiledev/2-4/property-template-references.html).

### <a id="multiple-bosh-releases"></a> Associate Multiple BOSH Releases with the BOSH Director Simultaneously

You can add multiple BOSH releases to a BOSH Director by . Additional releases can enhance antivirus capabilities, add security features, or support monitoring features. Custom and standard BOSH releases are supported, but all additional releases must be available at an HTTP address. You cannot upload a second BOSH release directly to Ops Manager.

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: If a hosted BOSH release is no longer available but not removed from Ops Manager, it may cause the Director not to boot or <strong>Apply Changes</strong> to fail.</p>

### <a id="dns-form"></a> BOSH DNS Config Form Available In the BOSH Director

The BOSH Director has a new form allowing you to configure BOSH DNS. The **BOSH DNS Config** form lets you specify recursor addresses the DNS server should not use, enforce a recursor timeout, and add custom DNS handlers.

This change completes the deprecation of Consul that began in PCF 2.3. Consul DNS has caused stability issues in extant deployments and is being replaced by BOSH DNS. For more information, see the [Pivotal Application Service v2.3 Release Notes](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-3/pcf-release-notes/runtime-rn.html#remove-consul-agent).

### <a id="multiple-networks"></a> Associate an Instance Group with Multiple Networks Simultaneously

You can use the `resource_config` API endpoint to add multiple networks to Diego cells or instance groups. Define the networks as usual with the Ops Manager UI or API and then reference the networks with the `additional_network` key in the API.

For more information, see [Retrieving resources for a job](http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-4/opsman-api/#retrieving-resource-configuration-for-a-product).

### <a id="swap-size"></a> Swap Partition Size Is Configurable Via the API

You can customize the size of the swap partition of their VM memory as a percent of total memory size per instance group. 

For more information, see the [Retrieving resources for a job](http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-4/opsman-api/#retrieving-resource-configuration-for-a-product).

### <a id="expiring-certificates"></a> SAML Certificate Expiration Information Is Available Via the API

You can view the expiration date for your SAML service provider certificate with the `/api/v0/deployed/certificates` endpoint. 

For more information, see [Getting Information About Certificates from Products](http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-4/opsman-api/#getting-information-about-certificates-from-products).

### <a id='om-root-ca'></a> BOSH Director Can Include Ops Manager Root Certificate Authority

You can enable BOSH Director to include the Ops Manager root certificate authority certificate in the trust store of every VM it deploys.

For more information, see the [Security](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-3/om/gcp/config-manual.html#security) section of the BOSH Director configuration topic for your IaaS.

### <a id="additional-cpi-settings"></a> IaaS-Specific Global CPI Properties Are Configurable Via the API

You can provide additional global CPI properties via the `additional_cloud_properties` endpoint in the Ops Manager API. This allows you to set properties that would otherwise be unavailable in Ops Manager. The specific CPI properties you can set varies depending on your IaaS. 

After adding new global CPI properties, you can view the global CPI properties in use by sending a GET to `/api/v0/staged/director/iaas_configurations`.

For more information, see [Updating Director and IaaS Properties](http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-4/opsman-api/#updating-director-and-iaas-properties-experimental).
