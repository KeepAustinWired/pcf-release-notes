This topic describes breaking changes you should consider when upgrading to
Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) v2.4. For more information about important preparation you must take before upgrading, see [Upgrading Pivotal Cloud
Foundry](http://docs.pivotal.io/2-4/customizing/upgrading-pcf.html).




## <a id='pas'></a> Pivotal Application Service (PAS)

See the following PAS breaking changes:

None currently.




## <a id='opsman'></a> PCF Ops Manager

See the following PCF Ops Manager breaking changes:

* Ops Manager v2.4 does not support RELP.
* DNS config fields are no longer available at previously supported API endpoints. These fields are still supported, bu√üt have moved to a different part of the API. If you try to use outdated API endpoints, they will not work. For more information about the DNS Configuration API endpoints, see [Updating Director and IaaS properties](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-4/#updating-director-and-iaas-properties-experimental).


### <a id="excluded-recursors"></a> Excluded Recursors Field Is Moved in API

The `excluded_recursors` field is now grouped under `dns_configuration` instead of `director_configuration`
when you use the `GET /api/v0/staged/director/properties` API endpoint. This API endpoint
fetches BOSH Director, IaaS, and security properties. The moved field may break scripts if
they rely on the `GET` output.

For more information about the API endpoint, see [Staged BOSH
Director](http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-4/opsman-api/#staged-bosh-director) in the
Ops Manager API documentation.
